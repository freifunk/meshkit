= Installation instructions =

== 1. Install web2py and meshkit ==

First you need to install the web2py framework and then the meshkit
application.

=== 1.1 Depencies ===

 * python2.5 or python2.6
 * If using python 2.5: python-simplejson

=== 1.2 install web2py ===

Fortunately web2py installation is documented really well so there is
not much to say here. Please consult the web2py documentation for general
web2py help: http://www.web2py.com/examples/default/documentation

First of all you need to download and extract the web2py source 
code package:

$ wget http://www.web2py.com/examples/static/web2py_src.zip
$ unzip web2py_src.zip

=== 1.3 Install the meshkit application ===

Now change into the just extracted web2py folder and checkout the meshkit
application into the applications folder:

$ cd web2py/applications
$ svn co http://svn.augsburg.freifunk.net/meshkit/

=== 1.3 Starting/Deploying web2py ===

There are different options for deployment, but the easiest one is
to just run the web2py application with its integrated rocket webserver
directly. This can be done with the follwing command in the web2py folder:

$ python web2py.py --ip=0.0.0.0 --password=foobar --port=8000 --nogui

For other kinds of deployment and integration with different webservers
see http://web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/13

The meshkit/examples/ folder contains a sample config for apache2 + wsgi.

=== 1.4. Rewrite routes.py ===
Assume you only run web2py for the meshkit application. Thats why you want
to make meshkit the default application. To do this change into the web2py
directory and copy router.example.py to routes.py. Now edit the following
section like this:

routers = dict(
    # base router
    BASE = dict(
        default_application = 'meshkit',
    ),
)

=== 1.5 Login into Appadmin ===

Now it is time to login into appadmin of your freshly installed web2py
with your browser. Note: Login is only possible if you connect from 127.0.0.1 or
over a secured https connection, but the latter one would require to use the ssl
options when starting web2py in the last step.
So if your installation is not on localhost help yourself with ssh-tunneling:

$ ssh <serverip> -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000

Now open the url http://127.0.0.1:8000/meshkit/admin/default/index and login with the
password you set when starting web2py.

You will see 4 applications now: admin, examples, meshkit and welcome. If you like
you can delete examples and welcome now or any time later.

=== 1.6 Configure meshkit ===

==== 1.6.1 General app configuration ====
Click the "Edit" button of the meshkit application. After that click "Edit" next
to 0.py. Alternatively edit it from shell in the file
web2py/applications/meshkit/models/0.py

Edit the settings (starting with settings.*) to suit your needs here.

==== 1.6.2 Configure Meshkit ====
Now you need to configure meshkit. To do that go to:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/appadmin/select/db?query=db.config.id>0

Now click the "insert new config" link to create a new config database row.

Noconf:			Globally disable configuration. Check this if you only
			want to build images, but not configure anything.

Communitysupport:	Check this if you want to use meshkit to create images
			for wireless communities. It will support community
			profiles then. Profiles are taken from:
			http://luci.subsignal.org/trac/browser/luci/trunk/contrib/package/community-profiles/files/etc/config
			You need to checkout those and save them in a local directory.
			You should setup a cronjob to autoupdate them periodically.

Profiles:		The path where the community profiles are stored locally.
			You only need to set this if Communitysupport is enabled.
			This must start end end with a slash ("/")

Communityfiles Dir:	Directory where custom files files for communities are stored
			which will be copied into the generated firmware image.
			You only need to set this if Communitysupport is enabled.
			This must start end end with a slash ("/")

Buildroots Dir:		This is the directory where meshkit can find your
			extracted OpenWrt imagebuilders. Make sure this path
			exists and the user running web2py has read and write
			access to everything inside it.
			Web2py shows the single imagebuilders in this directory
			with their full name in the dropdown selection. So you
			may rename these to some nices names, e.g.
			ar71xx-backfire-10.03.1
			This must start end end with a slash ("/")

Images Output Dir:	This is the local path where generated images should
			be stored after they are generated. Make sure the
			user running web2py has read and write access to it.
			This must start end end with a slash ("/")

Images Web Dir:		The web accessible path where users can download the
			generated images. I assume you have some webserver
			running which allows access to this path. If you don't
			you may set Images Web Dir to static/images
			and use http://<url>/static/images here.

Add Defaultpackages:	A space seperated list of packages that should be added
			to all generated images

Keep Images:		How long (in hours) generated images are kept in
			"Images Output Dir" before they are deleted by the
			internal cronjob. Set to 0 to never delete them.

Webifs:			Webinterfaces to offer in the select field for webinterface
			seperated by comma, e.g.
			luci, none

Lucipackages:		Packages to add to the package list to install if luci
			is selected as webinterface. Seperated by space.

IPv6Packages		Packages to add to the package list if IPv6 is enabled.
			Only used when Communitysupport is enabled.
			Seperated by space.

Defaulttheme:		Theme which should be preselected in the dropdown for theme
			selection, e.g.: luci-theme-bootstrap

Adminmail:		Your email. Mails about errors are sent there.

Lanprotos:		Protocols to offer in the Protocol selectbox for LAN
			configuration seperated by commas. Currently
			static and olsr are possible values here. You should set
			static first because thats the OpenWrt default, e.g.
			static, olsr

Wanprotos:		Protocols to offer in the Protocol selectbox for WAN
			configuration seperated by commas. Currently
			dhcp, static and olsr are possible values here. You should set
			dhcp first because thats the OpenWrt default, e.g.
			dhcp, static, olsr

Expandablehelp:		If set helptexts will be expandable. If not they are always
			shown.

Click to delete:	This would delete this config row. Do NOT check this!

== 2. Build queue ==

The build queue will be started automatically if you visit your page
(the frontend of it to be precise) for the first time. On every request
to the frontend it checks if the build queue is still running. If not
it is restarted.

=== 2.1 Killing the build queue === 
You can do this with the usual linux commands:

$ ps ax |grep build_queue
$ kill <pid>

=== 2.2 manually starting the build queue ===

Change to the web2py folder and execute:
$ python web2py.py -S meshkit -M -R applications/meshkit/private/build_queue.py

== 3. Notes ==

 * to speed things up some files like packagelists and output from "make info"
   are permanantly cached. If you update the package lists of your imagebuilder
   or change profiles you need to delete the static json files inside
   applications/meshkit/static/package_lists
 * if you want to use different favicons just replace the .ico and .png in static/
