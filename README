== Overview ==
This is an application for web2py and is used to build preconfigured firmware
images for openwrt and LEDE and is a rewrite of the "Freifunk OpenWrt Imagebuilder" [1].

Meshkit is mainly intended to be used for creating
firmware images for wireless communities like Freifunk that are
"ready-to-mesh" directly after they have been flashed on a router. But with
the "noconf" config option it is also possible to use it just to build
OpenWrt images with a custom package selection and uploaded files included.

== A few words about how image configuration works ==
Meshkit itself just writes a uci config file and stores it in
/etc/config/meshkwizard in the resulting firmware image. The actual
configuration is done by meshwizard [2], which uses community profiles [3]
and the settings from meshkit to configure the device at first boot after
the device has been flashed.

== INSTALLATION ==
See the INSTALL file for installing and configuring meshkit.

== DEVELOPMENT ==

== CONFIG ==
Different Communities can have different configs. this can be edited via
https://github.com/openwrt/luci/tree/master/contrib/package/community-profiles/files/etc/config
and special files here
